      <h1>Multi-variate data</h1>

      Multi-variate data have one or more independent variables and more than one dependent ones.
      Think, for instance, of weight-at-time for females and males.
      Since AmP deals (in principle) with an arbitrary number of data sets, and a collection of uni-variate data sets can have the same independent variable
      and presented in a grouped plot, there is no need other than convenience to deal with multi-variate data explicitly.
      Yet it can be handy to specify a multi-variate data set as a matrix where the first column is treated as the independent variable and the others are dependent ones.
      The specification in AmP follows the rules of those for bi-variate data, where the first element of <code>auxData.treat</code> is 0 or 1.
      See further under <a href="Bi-variate.html">bi-variate data</a>.

      <p>
      If the data-matrix has 3 columns, so 1 independent variable and 2 dependent ones, and if the units as well as the label for that data set have length 3,
      a plot is created with 2 different y-axes.
      The first element of treat must then be 0 or 1, not 2, and no legend is produced. 
      All that relates to the left yaxis is plotted in red, to the right in blue.
