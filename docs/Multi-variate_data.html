      <h1>Multi-variate data</h1>

      Multi-variate data has one or more independent variables and more than one dependent ones.
      Think, for instance, of weight-at-time for females and males.
      The concept that predictions for the various data are coupled by sharing parameters is key to DEB theory as well as to multi-variate data.

      <p>
      <a href="Uni_variate_data.html">Uni-</a>, <a href="Bi_variate_data.html">bi-</a> and <a href="Tri-variate_data.html">tri-variate</a>
      variables have one, two or three <b>independent</b> variables.
      More independent variables can be included via <a href="Auxiliary_data.html">auxiliary data</a>. 

      <p>
      Since AmP deals with an arbitrary number of data sets, and a collection of uni-variate data sets can have the same independent variable
      and presented in a grouped plot, there is no need, other than convenience, to deal with multi-variate data with several <b>dependent</b> variables explicitly.
      To present a set of uni-variate data in a grouped plot, they all must have the same units and labels.
      To produce a grouped plot, the metaData as defined in a mydata-file needs to have field <code>metaData.grp.sets</code> and, optionally,
      fields <code>metaData.grp.title</code> and <code>metaData.grp.subtitle</code>.
      A title becomes part of the produced png-file, a subtitle not and is only shown in the modal-presentation of the plot (i.e. after clicking on it).
      An example of a grouped plot is given in the <a href="https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/entries_web/Canis_familiaris/Canis_familiaris_res.html">dog-entry</a>.
      Bi- and tri-variate data sets do not need a grouped-plot definition;
      it is not possible to combine such data sets with other data sets in a grouped plot.

      <p>
      Yet it can be handy to specify a multi-variate data set as a matrix where the first column is treated as the independent variable and the others are dependent ones.
      The specification in AmP follows the rules of those for bi-variate data, where the first element of <code>auxData.treat</code> is 0 or 1.
      See further under <a href="Bi-variate_data.html">bi-variate data</a>.

      <p>
      If a data-matrix has 3 columns, i.e. 1 independent variable and 2 dependent ones, and if the units as well as the label for that data set is a cell-string of length 3,
      a plot is created with 2 different y-axes.
      The first element of treat must then be 0 or 1, not 2, and no legend is produced. 
      All that relates to the left yaxis is plotted in red, to the right in blue.
      An example of a plot with two different y-axes is given in the entries
      <a href="https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/entries_web/Vipera_aspis/Vipera_aspis_res.html">Vipera_aspis</a> and,
