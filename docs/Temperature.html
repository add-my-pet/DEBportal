      <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
      All rates and ages depend on temperature; all AmP parameters are expressed at the reference temperature of 20 &deg;C.
      The body temperature of aquatic ectotherms is (almost) equal to the water temperature, but that of terrestrial ones depend on a large number of factors.
      <a href="https://youtu.be/HWcPzZ23p5s" target="_blank"><img src="img/YouTube.png"  height = "25px"></a>
      Endotherms regulate their body temperature after birth at species-specific levels, but that of neonates can deviate substantially;
      the temperature in bird Eggs typically follows a trajectory. 
      Temperature is stored as auxilliary data in the mydata file, and used for calculating model predictions.

      <p>
      <a href="https://add-my-pet.github.io/DEBtool_M/lib/misc/html/tempcorr.html">Correcting for temperature using the Arrhenius temperature correction model</a>
      amounts to a simple transformation of ages and rates by multiplying or dividing by temperature correction factor (c_T).
      What is important to keep in mind though is that metabolic rates depend on temperature in a non linear way.
      If the temperature was fluctuating rather than constant, the mean temperature has a non-straight-forward relationship with the mean c_T.

      <p>
      A number of data sets (field or laboratory) are acquired at non-constant (fluctuating) temperatures.
      One is tempted to calculate the mean value of temperatures
      (T_mean) and then correct the metabolic rates with the c_T for that (T_mean) temperature. The problem arises, however,
      when the experienced (fluctuating) temperatures had a larger effect in low or high part of the range, which is often the case.

      <p>
      The presented procedure shows how to:
      <ol>
        <li>Obtain environmental temperature values if temperatures are not reported but the geographic location is known;
        <li>Use the temperature values in combination with the Arrhenius temperature correction model
	<li>Obtain and use c_T as a function of time.
      </ol>
      For a concrete example including code for R see below.

      <p>
      The final result is either a (single) temperature (for zero-variate data) or a vector of temperatures (for Uni-variate data) that are taking
      into account species-specific metabolic traits, and are thus more appropriate in the context of energetic modeling.
    
      <h2>Method</h2>
    
      <h3>
        Environmental temperature as a function of time 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/wxZm9cDdBRY" target="_blank"><img src="img/YouTube.png"  height = "25px" title="12:32"></a>
      </h3>
      If you do not have data about environmental temperature associated with your dataset, you can use one of these options.
      <ul>
        <li>Option 1: Use R package link RNCEP: global weather and climate data at your fingertips to make a query and download environmental temperature data
  	  for a given geographic location and a specific timeframe.
	
        <li>Option 2: Use R to query a global microclimate dataset. These estimates are for the middle day of each month, based on long-term average macroclimates.
	
        <li>Option 3: If working with a terrestrial ectotherm, you can improve accuracy of your temperature data (obtained via any of the previous steps)
  	  by simulating behavior of the species of interest with the NicheMapR microclimate model.
      </ul>

      <h3>Defining parameters of the Arrhenius temperature correction model</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Option 1: Use data on (developmental, metabolic, or other) rates at several different temperatures to estimate parameters of the Arrhenius temperature correction model
 	  (T_ref, T_A, T_AL, T_AH, T_L, T_H).

        <li>Option 2: Find the Arrhenius parameters for your species in literature, and input them directly into your script.
      </ul>
    	
      <h3>c_T as a function of time and using the back-calculated temperature</h3>
      Using the temperature correction model, calculate the temperature correction (c_T) for each temperature point obtained in Step 1.

      <p>
      For associating a temperature with a zero-variate data (e.g. age at puberty at a given food level) calculate the mean of all c_T values.
      Then convert the obtained mean(c_T) to the equivalent temperature using again the Arrhenius parameters.
      The back-calculated temperature is the 'constant temperature equivalent'.

      <p>
      For obtaining temperatures for specific time points in Uni-variate data, you will need to interpolate using the pairs of time-c_T values you have obtained in previous steps.
      It is possible to save either the c_T values or back calculated temperature values as a .csv file. This can then be called in the mydata file and stored in the auxData structure.

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <a href"Field_body_temperature.html">Here</a> you can find an example where we use the sand lizard, Lacerta agilis,
      which is in the AmP collection and has field growth observations for a number of locations in Russia.
      The document describes step-by-step the procedure (including NicheMapR)and provides R code you can use and modify.
