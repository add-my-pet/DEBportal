    <h1>Bi-variate data</h1>
    
    Bi-variate data is a matrix of dependent variables, but since each row typically has an associated independent data point,
    bi-variate data is specified with the associated first independent variable specified as first column of the matrix.
    The second independent variable is specified as auxiliary data of the type <code>treat</code>, not as a first row of the data-matrix.
    The reason is that it can be quantitative or qualitative, such as "female" and "male".
    This might also apply to the first independent variable, which needs to be numeric, but we might not allow interpolation for presentation purposes.
    An extra complicating factor is that particular data-points might be missing.
    For this reason the code accepts such missing data if specified as <code>NaN</code> (Not a Number).
    Other auxiliary data might be associated to any data, so also to bi-variate data.
    The predict-file should specify the prediction for all dependent variables in matrix-form (and not include the independent variables).
    Bi-variate data does not have a separate coding system, since the underscore-extension of uni-variate data gives suffient possibilities to specify codes.

    <h2>Specifying bi-variate data</h2>
    The entries <a href="https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/entries_web/Cuon_alpinus/Cuon_alpinus_res.html">Cuon alpinus</a> and
    <a href="https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/entries_web/Culex_pipiens/Culex_pipiens_res.html">Culex_pipiens</a>
    give examples of specification of bi-variate data in the mydata-file.
    Suppose that we want to specify time-weight data for females and males in data matrix <code>data.tW</code>, which now has 3 columns.
    The auxiliary data of the type <code>treat</code> is specified as a cell-string of 2 elements: <code>auxData.treat.tW = {1, {'f', 'm'})</code>.
    The second element specifies the second independent variable, which can be a vector of values, but is here a cell-string of labels.
    The first element is a scalar, which controls the way in which the results are presented.
    It can have the values
    <ul>
      <li> 0 for no interpolating the first as well as the second independent variable; the result is a plot with markers;
	filled dots for data, open ones for predictions.
	A legend will be plotted in a separate figure.
      <li> 1 for interpolating the first independent variablem but not the second one: the results is a plot with filled dots for the data and curves for the predictions;
	A legend will be plotted in a separate figure.
      <li> 2 for interpolating the first as well as the second independent variable; the result is a plot with filled dots for the data and a 3-dim mesh for the predictions.
	The data-points are connected to the mesh in red if above the mesh, or blue under.
	Matlab allows rotation of the plot in the tool-bar of the figure.
    </ul>
    In the example <code>treat</code> is added directly to <code>auxData</code>, but this is more typically done in 2 steps, by first filling <code>treat</code>
    and later in the mydata-file adding <code>treat</code> to <code>auxData</code> by <code>auxData.treat = treat</code>.
    You can specify a title for the legend by <code>label.treat.tW = 'gender';</code> and later add <code>label</code> to <code>txtData</code> (as usual).

    <p>
    Like for all plots, you can specify a title and/or a subtitle, e.g. <code>txtData.title.tW = 'data for females, males'</code>.
    Titles are part of the plot, but subtitles only appear in the modal-presentation in html on the AmP website.
    The latter might be more attractive if you want to use the plot for publication.
