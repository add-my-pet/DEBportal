          <h2 class="DEB">What is DEB theory?</h2>      
          DEB stands for Dynamic Energy Budget.
          "Dynamic" means that the full life cycle of an individual (micro-organism, plant, or animal) is followed in a changing environment.
          DEB theory deals with the processes of "Energy" uptake and use, but also with mass, including stoichiometric constraints and isotopes.
          "Budget" means that balances are respected explicitly.
          DEB theory unifies the commonalities between organisms as prescribed by the implications of energetics,
          which links different levels of biological organisation (cells, organisms and populations).
          The theory presents simple mechanistic rules that describe the uptake and use of energy and nutrients (substrates, food, light)
          and the consequences for physiological organisation throughout an organism's life cycle, including the relationships of energetics with aging and effects of toxicants. 
          All living organisms are covered in a single quantitative framework, the predictions of which are tested against a wide variety of experimental results 
          at the various levels of biological organisation. 

          <p>
          The advantage of applying the same family of models to all species is that species can be compared on the basis of parameter values.
          Parameter values are taken to be individual-specific, where the scatter of parameters for con-specific individuals is typically less than between species.
          The patterns in the co-variation of parameter values across populations and species is an increasingly important topic in DEB research, now parameters of 
          thousands of species are known, as shown in the
	  <a href="https://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/deb/deblab/add_my_pet/species_list.html">Add-my_Pet (AmP) collection for animal species</a>.
          The processes of ecological and evolutionary adaptation complement patterns that result from plain physics.

          This 2023 edition of the bi-yearly DEB tele-course is a great opportunity to learn the basics of the theory, as well as deepen one's knowledge ahead of the School, 
          Workshop, and Symposium later that year. 
          Many DEB researchers with a wide diversity of backgrounds will be interacting via the discussion board; many followed previous editions of the course/workshop/symposium. 
          Weekly discussion groups, formed based on geographical location, will include experienced as well as novice researchers.

          DEB literature and publications span from: introductory material in form of posters and micro-lectures and other course meterial to
          books (DEB3) with accompanying summary of concepts, notation document, and frequently updated Comments. 
          Over 1000 scientific publications with a focus on DEB theory and its applications are collected in the
	  <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/500643/deb_library/">Zotero DEB library</a>.
          Several (scientific) journal special issues have been dedicated to DEB theory, as can be found in our <a href="DEBpapers">small overview</a>.
